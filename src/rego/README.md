# Rego

Kubescape Regolibrary contains a library of security controls that codify Kubernetes best practices. Kubescape uses these controls to scan again running clusters or manifest files.

This folder contains downloads of controls, rules and frameworks from v2 in the rego repository. The downloads are updated with each new release of the Headlamp plugin, as specified in the Makefile.
