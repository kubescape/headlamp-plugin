# Kubescape Headlamp Plugin

The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides an open source plugin for Headlamp. It builds upon the work of [Kubescape](https://kubescape.io/) and [Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/).

Headlamp is a dashboard for Kubernetes, and is extensible with plugins. Kubescape is a security platform protecting against configuration issues and image vulnerabilities.

The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides views in Headlamp for configuration and vulnerabilities scanning, based on information delivered by the Kubescape operator.

## Demo

![compliance](./demo/compliance.png)

![vulnerabilities](./demo/vulnerabilities.png)

## Prerequisites

- [Kubescape operator](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) should be installed in the k8s cluster and enabled for configuration and image scanning.
  We recommend Kubescape operator helm chart v1.22.0 or later with `capabilities.continuousScan: enable`.

  If the operator is working, custom resources are generated. You can test this with e.g. `kubectl get workloadconfigurationscans -A`.

- [Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/) should be installed in the k8s cluster or workstation. For a quick test the desktop version is recommended.

The plugin has been tested with current versions of Headlamp (browser and desktop) and Kubescape operator.

## Functionality

- Compliancy overview page with views on controls, resources and namespaces.
- Vulnerabilities overview with views on CVEs, resources and images.
- Generated Network policies viewer.
- Playground for Validation Admission Policies.
- eBPF-based runtime threat detection
- Custom frameworks and exceptions

The queries to the Kubescape database use Headlamps feature `Allowed namespaces`, supporting multi tenant clusters. Configuration of this setting is done per user in Settings/Cluster.

You can create custom frameworks by combining one or more controls. These frameworks are stored as a ConfigMap in the Kubernetes cluster, within the namespace where Kubescape is installed, making them reusable. Additionally, you can export the frameworks to a JSON file, which can be used with the Kubescape CLI for scanning.

You can customize the compliance scan by adding an exception policy, which allows you to exclude specific namespaces, resources, or controls from the scan. These exceptions are stored in a ConfigMap within the Kubernetes cluster. You can also export them to a JSON file and use it with the Kubescape CLI `kubescape scan --exceptions /path/to/exceptions.json`.

## Installation

#### Desktop Headlamp

- Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/)
- Open Plugin Catalog
- Select the KubeScape Headlamp plugin and click the install button
- After install you may need to restart Headlamp

#### In-cluster Headlamp

- Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/)
- Deploy the container image `quay.io/kubescape/headlamp-plugin` as a sidecar container to the headlamp deployment. See [example helm values](https://github.com/kubescape/headlamp-plugin/blob/main/examples/headlamp-helm-values.yaml).

## Quick test

You can perform a quick test using a kind cluster.

### Create kind cluster

Install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) and create a new kind cluster.

### Install Kubescape operator

Install kubescape with helm:

```
helm repo add kubescape https://kubescape.github.io/helm-charts/
helm upgrade --install kubescape kubescape/kubescape-operator -n kubescape --create-namespace --set capabilities.runtimeDetection=enable --set alertCRD.installDefault=true --set nodeAgent.config.maxLearningPeriod=10m --set capabilities.continuousScan=enable
```

Note we set a short learning period. For a thorough training 24 hours would be recommended.

Wait a few moments for Kubescape to install. Check `kubectl get pods -n kubescape`.

### Test deployments

Install test deployments.

- Nginx `kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml -n default`
- Emojivoto `kubectl apply -k github.com/BuoyantIO/emojivoto/kustomize/deployment`

### Headlamp desktop

Start headlamp desktop, load the kubeconfig from the kind cluster. For the runtime scanning you need to wait 10 minutes, the learning period.

## Docs

[Notes](./docs/kubescape-model.md) about the Kubescape datamodel and how we leverage it for the plugin.

## Dependencies

- The plugin depends on documentation of configuration scanning in [Kubescape User Hub](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/controls).
- The plugin depends on JSON documentation in the [kubescape regolibrary](https://github.com/kubescape/regolibrary/releases/download/v2/controls/). The [control libary](./src/ConfigurationScanning/controlLibrary.js) is copied for use in the plugin code.
