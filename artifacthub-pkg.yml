  ## Kubescape Headlamp plugin

  The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides an open source plugin for Headlamp.

  [Kubescape](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) is a security platform protecting against configuration issues and image vulnerabilities.
  [Headlamp](https://kubescape.io/) is a dashboard for Kubernetes, and is extensible with plugins. 

  The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides views in Headlamp for configuration and vulnerabilities scanning, based on information delivered by the Kubescape operator.

  ## Prerequisites

  - [Kubescape operator](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) should be installed in the k8s cluster and enabled for configuration and image scanning.
    We recommend Kubescape operator with `capabilities.continuousScan: enable`.

    If the operator is working, custom resources are generated. You can test this with e.g. `kubectl get workloadconfigurationscans -A`.

  - [Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/) should be installed in the k8s cluster or workstation. For a quick test the desktop version is recommended.

  The plugin has been tested with current versions of Headlamp (browser and desktop) and Kubescape operator.

  ## Installation 

  Desktop Headlamp 
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/)
  - Open Plugin Catalog 
  - Select the KubeScape Headlamp plugin and click the install button
  - After install you may need to restart Headlamp 

  In-cluster Headlamp 
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/)
  - Deploy the container image `quay.io/kubescape/headlamp-plugin` as a sidecar container to the headlamp deployment. See [example helm values](https://github.com/kubescape/headlamp-plugin/blob/main/examples/headlamp-helm-values.yaml).

  ## Functionality

  - Compliancy overview page with views on controls, resources and namespaces.
  - Vulnerabilities overview with views on CVEs, resources and images.
  - Generated Network policies viewer.
  - Playground for Validation Admission Policies.
  - eBPF-based runtime threat detection
  - Custom frameworks and exceptions

  The queries to the Kubescape database use Headlamps feature `Allowed namespaces`, supporting multi tenant clusters. Configuration of this setting is done per user in Settings/Cluster.
